{{< lead >}}
A marketplace that connects customers to vetted house keepers. 
{{< /lead >}}

The platform that started it all. I've been running WAND since 2018 after co-founding it with a good friend. We're presently live in Denver, Seattle and St. Louis. Over the years, we've built a base of hundreds of cleaning providers and helped customers buy back thousands of hours of time. 

I now manage WAND primarily as an asset that allows me to spend most of my time working on new projects through consulting in addition to exploring other interests.
