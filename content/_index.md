A disciple of experience, seeking challenges and novelty.

Hey there, I'm Ben. I spend most of my time these days consulting, producing a [podcast](https://www.vancecrowe.com/podcast), [reading]({{< ref "books" >}}) to come up with new ideas, and writing about them [here](https://thebenjamin.substack.com/). 

I also have a knack for building [marketplaces]({{< ref "marketplaces" >}}) because I love helping users on one side of my platforms take ownership of their income and users on the other side buy back the one thing they thought that they couldn't: **time**.
