Aion's purpose is to uncover novel intervention strategies targeting aging. 

We are doing this by using computational appraoches to understand information flow in complex biological systems. We then seek to determine optimal strategies to modulate endogenous bioelectric networks for efficient, precise, and translational rejuvination.
