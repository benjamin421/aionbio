Hey there, I'm Ben. I spend most of my [time]({{< ref "about" >}}) these days consulting, producing a [podcast](https://www.vancecrowe.com/podcast), and helping others secure their life's wisdom through what we call a ['Legacy Interview'](https://legacyinterviews.com/).

My [research]({{< ref "research" >}}) is focussed on finding causality in complexity.
