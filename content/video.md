## Transcript
Hi, this is RJ Tevonian, co-founder and chief science officer of Aion Biosciences.
At Aion, our goal is to bring aging under complete biomedical control.
We think we will achieve this during our lifetimes by reading and writing to bioelectricity.
Bioelectricity is an emerging field where people examine the electricity in the body, manifested as voltage across cell membranes.

By observing this biophysical readout and modulating it with simple methods like chemicals or salts, researchers have achieved remarkable outcomes.

Michael Levin has induced cancer cells and reversed them to a healthy state without genetic changes. He has made eyes appear in developmental stages in unexpected places by altering the voltage of a few cells. He has created two-headed worms.

Clarence Cone has halted cell division and induced division in non-dividing cells like neurons by changing voltage.

This powerful tool exists in every organ system. However, it has not been effectively applied to aging.

The challenge is that bioelectric patterning across the body is not uniform. A drug distributing systemically fails, as it might stop the heart while targeting liver cells. To address this, we adapt neuroscience tools for remote reading and writing to neurons for other body cells.

Every cell behaves like a neuron, but on longer timescales. Skin cells depolarize over 16 hours; neurons over minutes. At Aion, we will read non-neuronal cells as quickly as neurons and write to them via closed-loop feedback machines. This bypasses drug and pharmacokinetic issues, targeting organs like liver, kidney, and thymus.

We believe this can solve aging, given outcomes from controlled drug experiments in dishes managing cell fate. We can reprogram cells to younger states using bioelectricity.

We have developed read and write technologies to monitor and modulate bioelectricity in real time, eventually in vivo.

One example is a genetically encoded voltage indicator, a marker viewed under microscope for real-time cell bioelectric data without invasive electrodes. Our imaging suites segment cells and track individual bioelectric waveforms over time to verify applied fields.

Optical methods are limited in vivo for deep tissue.

We use a custom MRI to image and write to cells simultaneously. MRI's history ties to bioelectricity: Raymond Damadian created it to image collapsed bioelectric states in cancer via NMR, later MRI, by water dynamic differences correlating with bioelectricity.

We correlate optical methods with MRI observables to translate microscope findings to deep tissue. We have developed read methods in microscopy, MRI, and electrophysiology.

Our write methods include a custom three-axis microscope magnet and benchtop MRI write coil. We observe cells under MRI and microscope, apply magnetic fields in real time, and assess functional readouts for field parameters in animals.

We explore broad parameter spaces with varied tools. We focus on sub-centimeter voxels in deep tissue, using penetrating acoustic and magnetic fields for spatial encoding.

We match drug efficacy in dishes with fields for spatiotemporal control as effective as any drug. We use state-of-the-art drug reprogramming as controls, like Yamanaka factors for stem cells.

We are working to achieve this with fields alone, without factors, for deep tissue use. We can apply this to aging reprogramming, stem cells, and cancer. In cancer, we examine biophysical readouts linked to bioelectricity and MRI, like water structure.

Our team includes CEO, Benjamin Anderson; me, chief science officer; 2 scientists and a founding engineer.

All of us wear multiple hats and are adaptable.

We aim to solve aging but need a beachhead market. We find this in thymus regeneration. This is an $80 billion addressable market for immune-compromised post-chemotherapy patients with shrunken thymuses.

We believe we can regrow thymuses using external fields. Various fate controls we know are explitable via bioelectricity all aid the thymus: differentiation, dedifferentiation, growth.

This is also attractive for longevity: after age 30, immunosenescence begins, the thymus shrinks which leads to inflammaging issues.

We want to build a giant company that puts a medbed in every home.
We can get there.

That's Aion.
