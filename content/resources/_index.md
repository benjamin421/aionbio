Knowledge onramps to the work we are doing
{{< /lead >}}

A pillar of our [ethos](https://www.aion.bio/about/#ethos) is a radically open policy on information exchange. We need to secure IP to stay fundable as a company, but at our core, we are about accelarating progress of longevity research in whatever form that takes.

Below is a handful of onramps to the programs outlined in our [research roadmap](https://www.aion.bio/research-roadmap/). 

If you have questions about anything you read here, or are interested in joining our internal efforts to tackle these objectives, send us a note to [info@aion.bio](mailto:info@aion.bio).
