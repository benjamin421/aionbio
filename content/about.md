Aion's purpose is to uncover novel intervention strategies targeting aging.

## Science
> ANTEATER: Now the state can be described on a low level or on a high level. A low-level description of the state of an ant colony would involve painfully specifying the location of each ant, its age and caste, and other similar items. A very detailed description, yielding practically no global insight as to why it is in that state. On the other hand, a description on a high level would involve specifying which symbols could be triggered by which combinations of other symbols, under what conditions, and so forth.

Our research focuses on investigating the flow of causally relevant information within complex biological systems, particularly in relation to endogenous bioelectric networks. By delving into the intricate communication and signaling mechanisms of living organisms, we aim to uncover optimal strategies that can effectively modulate these networks. Our ultimate goal is to harness this knowledge to develop innovative, precise, and translatable rejuvenation therapies. These techniques have the potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine, addressing age-related decline and improving overall health. By unlocking the secrets of bioelectric networks, we hope to pave the way for a future where rejuvenation and regeneration are possible and accessible to all.

## Aion in Mythology

In Greek Mythology, there are 3 gods who are associated with the concept of time: Chronos, Kairos and **Aion**.

Chronos represents the linear and cyclical progression of time. He is the personification of time itself, and is often depicted as an old, bearded man or as a serpent or dragon with three heads.

Kairos, on the other hand, represents the fleeting and opportune moments of time. He is associated with the idea that there are certain moments or opportunities that must be seized at just the right time, and is often depicted as a young man with a lock of hair hanging over his forehead. 

Aion was the Greek god of eternity, often depicted as a young man with a lion's head and wings. He was considered a primordial deity, representing the concept of time as infinite and cyclical. Aion was associated with the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth, and was believed to be the personification of the cosmic cycle of time that governs the universe.

In art, Aion was often depicted holding a serpent or a wheel, which symbolized the continuous motion of time. The serpent was associated with regeneration and renewal, as it sheds its skin and is reborn, while the wheel symbolized the cyclical nature of time, with no beginning or end. Sometimes, Aion was also depicted with a cornucopia or a bunch of grapes, symbolizing the abundance of time and the bounty of life.

Aion's association with time as eternal and cyclical made him an important figure in religious and philosophical discourse in ancient Greece. He was often invoked in mysteries and cults as a symbol of the eternal and transcendent aspects of the universe. In some traditions, Aion was considered the son of Chronos, the god of time, and was believed to be the creative force that brought order to the universe after Chronos had consumed all his offspring.

Aion is our patron of choice because of the 3, this figure was most closely represented with perpetual, unbound and eternal time.
