We are on a mission to reshape regenerative medicine.
{{< /lead >}}

Current reprogramming methods are slow, inefficient, and often unpredictable - we believe bioelectric modulation holds the key to unlocking faster, more efficient reprogramming. 

Traditional methods use a 'bottom up' approach that has low efficiency and variable quality. The bioelectric method would be a 'top down' approach that acts on the physiology of the cell to have a more dramatic and immediate effect. Aion Biosciences aims to develop the bioelectric method, then combine these approaches to 'meet in the middle', with two initial goals: 

1) Increase reprogramming efficiency by an order of magnitude 
2) Cut the time of current reprogramming methods by half

These goals are ambitious; however, they are an essential proof-of-concept for technologies Aion Biosciences will develop and introduce into the field of regenerative medicine in the coming years.
