## About Us
We are on a mission to reshape regenerative medicine. Current reprogramming methods are slow, inefficient, and often unpredictable - we believe bioelectric modulation holds the key to unlocking faster, more efficient reprogramming. 

Traditional methods use a 'bottom up' approach that has low efficiency and variable quality. The bioelectric method would be a 'top down' approach that acts on the physiology of the cell to have a more dramatic and immediate effect. Aion Biosciences aims to develop the bioelectric method, then combine these approaches to 'meet in the middle', with two initial goals: 

1) Increase reprogramming efficiency by an order of magnitude 
2) Cut the time of current reprogramming methods by half

These goals are ambitious; however, they are an essential proof-of-concept for technologies Aion Biosciences will develop and introduce into the field of regenerative medicine in the coming years.

## Key Responsibilities
- Develop and optimize protocols integrating bioelectric modulation with a range of reprogramming methodologies. 
- Analyze complex datasets to identify optimal bioelectric parameters for reprogramming.
- Work closely with our business team to ensure that our scientific advancements align with and drive our strategic goals.
- Adapt quickly to changing priorities and drive projects with minimal supervision.

## Requirements
- Ph.D. in Bioengineering, Stem Cell Biology, or a related field.
- 3+ years of post-PhD experience in stem cell biology or a related field.
- Strong foundation in cellular biology and bioengineering; experience with bioelectricity/ion channels is a plus, but not required.
- Strong background in iPSC generation and characterization.
- Background in bioinformatics and data analysis, with proficiency in Python and/or R is a plus, but not required.
- Proven track record of designing experiments resulting in either high-impact publications or commercial endpoints.
- Hands-on experience with CRISPR-Cas9, optogenetics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and patch-clamp electrophysiology is highly desirable.
- Basic understanding of IP strategy and regulatory pathways in biotech are preferred.

## Essential Qualities
- Entrepreneurial mindset with a high tolerance for ambiguity and risk.
- Exceptional problem-solving skills and ability to work with limited resources.
- Strong communication skills, able to convey complex ideas to diverse audiences.
- Flexibility to wear multiple hats and adapt quickly to changing priorities.
- Passion for translating cutting-edge science into real-world applications.

## What We Offer
- Competitive salary, based on experience.
- Substantial equity stake
- Opportunity to shape a potentially industry-defining company from its inception.
- Autonomy to drive critical scientific and business decisions.
- A collaborative environment where your ideas will be heard and valued.
- Opportunity to work on technology with the potential to transform regenerative medicine.
