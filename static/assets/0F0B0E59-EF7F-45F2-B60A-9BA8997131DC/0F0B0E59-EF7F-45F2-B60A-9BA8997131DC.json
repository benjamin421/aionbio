Water polarity, under NMR (MRI), is proportional to microtubule content. Microtubules have a high surface area in cells and may polarize the majority of cell water in slow-growing cells. Microtubules have a disordered C-terminal domain which can either adsorb ions or fold onto the rest of the microtubule. Microtubules have been shown to exhibit memristive properties at the sub-cellular level. Adsorption and desorption of ions alters the surface potential, creating an ion-dependent voltage without requiring a membrane. Furthermore, changes in pKa of negatively charged carboxyl groups on the CTD of microtubules can lead to changes in desorption kinetics. This is predicted under Gilbert Lingâ€™s Association-Induction Hypothesis. Disordered proteins are seen to have exposed partial negative and positive charges across the backbone, polarizing and orienting water dipoles in a checkerboard pattern. When the CTDs are either folded into tubulin monomers or folded onto the microtubule complex due to desorption of ions, the water is depolarized, as the partial charges are now participating in alpha helices.","targetRectangle":{"y":80.227506637573242,"x":108.80342102050781,"width":1160.4681081321044,"height":485.57997523248196}},{"text":"inverted_polarity.png","targetRectangle":{"y":286.18572998046875,"x":616.66259765625,"width":636,"height":274}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.00035007912466775983,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":960,"pointY":540},"width":1920,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"FB3362B7372AD0B00D8ACB069AA5ABBE"}]}]}}]}
