This makes flow cytometry, rather than microscopy with a fixed exposure time, the ideal assay. Total dye uptake is increased as the dye shifts red, which is the opposite trend of quantum yield, which increases with blue-shift. This is consistent with Gilbert Ling’s AIH, where water polarization partially excludes solutes from the cell.
